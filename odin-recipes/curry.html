      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>The coconut, curry, and mango chutney really turn the flavor up in this curry chili recipe. I put this together one night with what I had, and loved the results. It tastes better the next day, just like most chili, and even freezes well. Seriously, you have to try it. Serve by itself, with rice, or with naan bread.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>½ pound ground turkey</li>
        <li>2 (10.75 ounce) cans tomato soup</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can red kidney beans, drained and rinsed</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped carrot</li>
        <li>¼ cup mango chutney</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup coconut milk, divided</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 1</h4>
            <p>Break ground turkey into small pieces into a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir turkey, continuing to break it into smaller pieces until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain as much grease as possible from turkey.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 2</h4>
            <p>Combine tomato soup, water, and minced garlic in a large pot; bring to a boil. Add turkey to the pot and return mixture to a boil and reduce heat to medium-low. Stir chickpeas, red kidney beans, carrot, chutney, curry powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper through turkey mixture; bring to a simmer, place a cover on the pot, and cook until chickpeas are tender, about 15 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Step 3</h4>
            <p>Stir 1/4 cup coconut milk through chili, return cover to the pot, and simmer another 15 minutes. Pour the remaining 1/4 cup coconut milk into chili, stir, and simmer 30 minutes more.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
